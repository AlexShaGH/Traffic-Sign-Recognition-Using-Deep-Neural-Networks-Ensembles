Traffic Sign Recognition Using Deep Neural Networks Ensembles

This is a course project for CS 577 Deep Learning class at Illinois Institute of Technology, 2021

This work:
1) Explores performance of known deep learning network architectures for classifying US traffic signs
2) Combines several network architectures into an ensemble and evaluates its performance in comparison to its components
